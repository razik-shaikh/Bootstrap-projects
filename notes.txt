Bootstrap:
Bootstrap is a collection of pre-styled CSS classes, JavaScript components, and a responsive grid system. It helps you:

* Create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
* Use pre-designed components like buttons, forms, modals, and navbars.
* Save time by not starting your CSS from scratch.
